# Patch Notes

Running changelog for Cat Food Center. Add an entry to the top for every meaningful change. Keep `PRD.md` in sync whenever product behavior or the scoring model changes.

Format: newest first. Use semantic-ish version tags (major.minor.patch). Pre-launch work lives under 0.x.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-07

**MVP complete: GitHub Pages deployment config.**

Added
* `next.config.ts`: set `basePath` and `assetPrefix` to `/Cat-Food-Center` for deployment at `https://azqato.github.io/Cat-Food-Center/`. Both values are derived from a single `REPO` constant at the top of the file — change it there if the repo name changes.

Confirmed present (from earlier prompts)
* `public/.nojekyll`: prevents GitHub Pages from running Jekyll on the `out/` directory.
* `.gitignore`: `out/` excluded from version control; the built output is deployed separately.

Deployment steps (run after `npm install` with Node.js LTS installed)
1. `npm run build` → produces `out/`
2. Push `out/` contents to the `gh-pages` branch of `https://github.com/Azqato/Cat-Food-Center.git`, or configure a GitHub Actions workflow to do so on push to `main`.
3. In repo Settings → Pages, set source to the `gh-pages` branch, root (`/`).

Build verification
* Node.js was not present on the development machine during this session; `npm run build` could not be confirmed. Run it manually after installing Node.js LTS from nodejs.org. Expected output: a clean `out/` directory with `index.html`, `search/`, `product/0000000000000/`, `product/0000000000001/`, `product/0000000000002/`, and all static assets.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-07

**Prompt 3: Mock product page, search page, emoji favicon.**

Added
* `app/product/[barcode]/page.tsx`: full product page layout per `DESIGN.md` section 7.3, populated with hardcoded mock data (Instinct Original Grain-Free with Real Chicken, score 61, Good band). Sections rendered:
  * Score header — 6px band-good color bar, 3rem score number, check glyph + band label, product image placeholder, product name (h1), brand / format / life-stage meta.
  * Verdict — one-sentence summary and three reason chips as pills.
  * Ingredients — numbered ordered list of 24 ingredients with a chevron hint; expand logic deferred (TODO comment).
  * Additive flags — Tier 2 Moderate Risk section with two cards (Carrageenan, Guar Gum), each showing function badge, health impact, and a cited source link.
  * Nutrition snapshot — 2×2 grid: Crude Protein 52% DM, Crude Fat 28% DM, Moisture 78% as-fed, Taurine Present (with check glyph). Tabular figures throughout.
  * AAFCO adequacy — quoted statement + substantiation method.
  * Footer metadata — data-completeness indicator and last-reviewed date.
* `app/search/SearchView.tsx` (`'use client'`): search input pre-filled from `?q=` param; on submit navigates to `/search?q=`; displays three hardcoded result cards (Instinct Chicken / Salmon / Duck variants, all score ~60, Good band) each linking to `/product/0000000000000`.
* `app/search/page.tsx`: rewritten as a server component that wraps `SearchView` in `<Suspense>` (required by Next.js static export when `useSearchParams` is used).
* `public/favicon.svg`: 😻 emoji as an SVG favicon.
* `app/layout.tsx`: wired `favicon.svg` via `metadata.icons`.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-07

**Prompt 2: Home page.**

Added
* `app/page.tsx`: full home page layout per `DESIGN.md` section 7.1.
  * Wordmark (`<h1>`) in Fraunces display serif with tagline.
  * 128px circular Scan button in accent color — disabled state with opacity, `cursor-not-allowed`, and a CSS tooltip ("Coming soon") on hover. Accessible via `aria-disabled` and `aria-describedby`.
  * Search form (`role="search"`) — text input + Submit button; on submit, navigates to `/search?q=<query>` via `useRouter`.
  * "Recently viewed" section with two hardcoded mock product cards: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken (score 81, Excellent) and Friskies Surfin' & Turfin' Favorites (score 28, Poor). Each card shows the score badge in band color, product name, brand, band pill, and a chevron.
* `app/product/[barcode]/page.tsx`: added mock barcodes `0000000000001` and `0000000000002` to `generateStaticParams` so the static export generates pages the recently-viewed links point to.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-07

**Prompt 1: Project scaffold, design tokens, global layout.**

Added
* `package.json`: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS 3, TypeScript 5.
* `tsconfig.json`: strict mode, App Router moduleResolution.
* `next.config.ts`: `output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash`, `images.unoptimized` — static GitHub Pages build. `basePath`/`assetPrefix` left as TODO for Prompt 4.
* `tailwind.config.ts`: all design tokens from `DESIGN.md` wired as Tailwind theme extensions — colors (`bg`, `surface`, `ink`, `ink-soft`, `accent`, `hairline`, four band colors), font families (`font-display` → Fraunces, `font-body` → Public Sans), type scale (`text-display` through `text-micro`), border radius (`rounded-card`, `rounded-pill`), max-width (`max-w-content`).
* `postcss.config.mjs`: Tailwind + autoprefixer.
* `.eslintrc.json`: `next/core-web-vitals`.
* `.gitignore`: ignores `out/`, `.next/`, `node_modules/`, `next-env.d.ts`.
* `app/globals.css`: Tailwind directives plus `:root` CSS custom properties for all design tokens.
* `app/layout.tsx`: loads Fraunces (`--font-display`) and Public Sans (`--font-body`) via `next/font/google`; mounts `<Header>` and `<Footer>` around a flex-column `<body>`.
* `components/Header.tsx`: sticky header — wordmark in display serif linking to `/`, Support pill button linking to `https://azqato.github.io/support.html`.
* `components/Footer.tsx`: "Built by Azqato" centered footer with link to `https://azqato.github.io/index.html`.
* `app/page.tsx`, `app/search/page.tsx`, `app/product/[barcode]/page.tsx`: build-passing stubs; product route includes `generateStaticParams` required by static export.
* `public/.nojekyll`: prevents GitHub Pages Jekyll processing.

Next up
* Install Node.js (not present on dev machine), run `npm install`, verify `npm run build` produces a clean `out/`.
* Prompt 2: home page with scan button, search input, recently-viewed strip.
* Prompt 3: mock product page (full visual) and mock search results.
* Prompt 4: GitHub Pages `basePath`/`assetPrefix` config and final PATCHNOTES entry.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-07

**Documentation updates: global chrome and MVP strategy.**

Changed
* `DESIGN.md`: added section 7.0 defining a persistent header (wordmark + Support button linking to `https://azqato.github.io/support.html`) and footer ("Built by Azqato" linking to `https://azqato.github.io/index.html`) present on all screens.
* `PRD.md`: added section 4.1 capturing the header/footer as product requirements.
* `TRD.md`: added section 0 (MVP strategy) — static Next.js export targeting GitHub Pages with hardcoded mock data first, real API wiring later. Updated section 8 global layout spec.
* `README.md`: updated status to reflect MVP-first approach.
* `PATCHNOTES.md`: this entry.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

**Project kickoff: foundational documentation.**

Added
* `README.md`: project overview, feature summary, tech stack, quick start.
* `PRD.md`: living spec, including the full CFC Score rating methodology (three pillars, additive risk tiers, hard gates, score bands, worked example).
* `TRD.md`: architecture, TypeScript data model, scoring-engine pipeline, data sources, testing strategy.
* `DESIGN.md`: editorial visual language, design tokens, typography, color and band system, screen specs, accessibility.
* `PATCHNOTES.md`: this changelog.

Decisions captured
* Cats are obligate carnivores, so the rating engine is purpose-built for feline nutrition and does not use human scoring systems such as Nutri-Score.
* Scoring weights set to Nutrition 55%, Additives 35%, Transparency 10%.
* High-risk (Tier 3) additives cap the score at 49; propylene glycol triggers an automatic Bad band because it is FDA-prohibited in cat food.
* Primary product data source is Open Pet Food Facts, supplemented by an internal additive knowledge base and an AAFCO feline nutrient reference.
* Stack: Next.js (App Router) plus TypeScript plus Tailwind CSS, delivered as a mobile-first installable PWA with browser support.

Next up
* Scaffold the Next.js PWA and Tailwind theme tokens from `DESIGN.md`.
* Build the deterministic scoring engine and its golden-file test suite.
* Seed the additive knowledge base (Tier 1 to Tier 3 entries with sources).
* Wire the barcode scanner (BarcodeDetector with ZXing fallback) and Open Pet Food Facts lookup.
